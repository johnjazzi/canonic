## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
- Provide specific examples or screenshots to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please provide:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- A step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement.
- A description of the current behavior and how your suggestion differs.
- Any mockups or visual representations if applicable.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or features, update the documentation (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` or `README.md`).
4. Ensure the application runs locally without errors.
5. Make sure your code follows the coding standards.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Standards

We aim to follow the latest and greatest best practices for Vue, JavaScript/Node, and Electron development. Please ensure your code aligns with these standards:

### 1. General JavaScript
- **Formatting:** We recommend using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting to keep styling consistent.
- **Linting:** Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to catch bugs and enforce style.
- **Modern Syntax:** Use modern ES6+ features (e.g., `let`/`const`, arrow functions, destructuring, optional chaining).
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - `camelCase` for variables, functions, and object properties.
  - `PascalCase` for classes and Vue components.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for global constants.

### 2. Vue 3 Guidelines
- Follow the essential rules of the official [Vue 3 Style Guide](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/).
- **Composition API:** We prefer the `<script setup>` syntax and the Composition API over the Options API for new components.
- **State Management:** Use [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for global state. Avoid deep prop-drilling.
- **Component Naming:** Multi-word component names are mandatory (e.g., `DocumentEditor.vue`, not `Editor.vue`) to prevent conflicts with native HTML elements.

### 3. Git & Commit Messages
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This leads to more readable messages and makes it easier to track the project's history.

Format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Common types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

*Example: `feat(editor): add support for mermaid diagrams`*

### 4. Architecture & Product Requirements
Before building a major feature, familiarize yourself with `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. It serves as the source of truth for product decisions and architectures.
- Product decisions live in the requirements document, not just in code comments.
- If a requirement changes as part of your PR, update `REQUIREMENTS.md` first, then the tests, and finally the code.
- Mark criteria `[DONE]` or `[PARTIAL]` in the document if your PR completes them.

## Getting Started Locally

See the [README.md](./README.md) for instructions on setting up your local development environment.
