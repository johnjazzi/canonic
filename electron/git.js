|---|---|
| **Branch** | A working draft or experiment — work here without affecting \`main\` |
| **Commit** | A saved checkpoint — like saving a version you can return to |
| **Merge** | Bring a branch's changes back into \`main\` when ready |

Start writing in any document. Use the branch selector in the toolbar to create drafts.

function getCanonicdemoFiles() {
  return {
    'Vision/product-vision.md': `# Product Vision

> What we're building and why it matters.

## Vision Statement

Canonic is a local-first document editor for product managers — built on Git — that makes version control, peer review, and AI-assisted thinking feel native to how good PMs already work.

## Problem We're Solving

Product managers write documents — PRDs, strategies, roadmaps — in tools that treat them as ephemeral notes. Notion, Google Docs, and Confluence have no concept of history, branching, or review. Decisions get made in comments that disappear. "Final_v3_APPROVED.docx" is still the state of the art.

The real problem isn't the format. It's that there's no shared ritual for saying "this document is ready to build from." Engineers have PRs. PMs have Slack threads.

## Why Now

Three things converged:

1. **Remote-first teams normalized async review.** The "walk over and ask" fallback is gone. Docs need to stand alone.
2. **AI can now act as a thinking partner.** The bottleneck isn't writing speed — it's thinking quality. Claude can challenge your reasoning before you've committed to it.
3. **Local-first is having a moment.** Developers are exhausted by SaaS tools that hold their data hostage. PMs are starting to feel the same way.

## Who This Is For

B2B product managers at 20–500 person companies who ship software. They write documents before building things. They collaborate with engineers and designers. They care about their decisions aging well — they want to look back at why they decided something, not just what.

Not for: enterprise PMOs, agencies, or anyone who needs a PM tool to also be a project tracker.
`,
    'Vision/north-star-metric.md': `# North Star Metric

> The one metric that best captures whether we're delivering value.

## Our North Star

**Committed docs per active workspace per month** — the number of documents a user saves a checkpoint commit on, per workspace they actively use.

Current baseline: 0 (pre-launch). Target by end of Q3: 3+ per workspace per month.

## Why This Metric

A commit is a meaningful act. It means the user trusted the document enough to snapshot it. It's the PM equivalent of merging a PR. If users aren't committing, they're using Canonic like a notes app — which means we haven't solved the alignment problem, we've just replaced Notion.

High commit frequency signals: the user understands the value of version control, they have something worth preserving, and they're developing a habit.

## Leading Indicators

- Files opened per session (are they coming back?)
- Time-to-first-commit per new workspace (are they getting it?)
- Comments added per doc (are they collaborating?)
- AI chat messages per session (are they thinking harder before committing?)
`,
    'Strategy/strategy.md': `# Strategy

> How we'll achieve the vision given our constraints.

## Strategic Bets

**1. Win the solo PM first.** No collaboration features required to get value. The version history alone is better than anything a PM has today. Land here, then expand to teams.

**2. Git vocabulary, PM framing.** Don't hide the model — explain it. "Branch" is a draft. "Commit" is a checkpoint. PMs who understand the metaphor become evangelists. PMs who don't get confused and churn. The README in every workspace explains this.

**3. AI as thinking partner, not ghostwriter.** Every other AI writing tool competes on output quality. We compete on decision quality. The AI asks questions, challenges assumptions, points out what's missing. It doesn't write your PRD — it makes your PRD worth building from.

**4. Open source → paid hosting.** Release the desktop app free and open. Sell the infrastructure (hosted relay, sync server, team access management) later. This keeps the core trustworthy and gives us a credible enterprise path without VC pressure to monetize day one.

## What We're NOT Doing

- Building a project tracker. Canonic is for pre-build alignment, not sprint management.
- Building a web app. Local-first means local-first. The desktop app is the product.
- Replacing GitHub for engineers. This is PM-layer tooling. It sits above the code.
- Supporting real-time collaborative editing (v1). Async review is the model.

## Key Assumptions

- PMs will adopt a new tool if it solves version history — the pain is high enough.
- The Git mental model is learnable by non-engineers if the UI explains it clearly.
- AI that pushes back is more valuable than AI that agrees with you.
- Open source creates enough trust and distribution to make the hosted tier viable.
`,
    'Strategy/competitive-analysis.md': `# Competitive Analysis

## Landscape Overview

The PM document space is dominated by general-purpose collaboration tools (Notion, Google Docs, Confluence) and task managers that bolt on docs (Linear, Jira). Nobody is building for the specific problem of document versioning and pre-build alignment.

## Competitors

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Differentiation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Notion** | Flexible, widely adopted, good for wikis | No version history, comments get lost, no branching | Git-native history + named versions + branch drafts |
| **Google Docs** | Real-time collab, version history exists | Version history is useless (auto-saves every few seconds), no structured review | Meaningful commits you choose, not noise |
| **Confluence** | Enterprise adoption, structured | Terrible UX, no AI, nobody actually reads Confluence | Modern editor, AI that challenges, not just stores |
| **Linear** | Excellent for eng workflow | Docs are second-class, no deep PM tooling | Documents as first-class artifacts with full git history |
| **Obsidian** | Local-first, powerful, markdown | No collaboration, no PM templates, no AI | Collaboration + PM-specific structure + AI thinking partner |

## Where We Win

Git under the hood means a real history model — branching, merging, named versions, diffs. No other PM tool has this because they built on databases, not files.

The AI angle is genuinely different: we tune the system prompt to ask questions, not generate answers. Most AI writing tools make you lazier. We're trying to make PMs think harder.

Local-first is a real differentiator for privacy-conscious teams and orgs that can't put product strategy in a SaaS tool.
`,
    'Planning/roadmap.md': `# Roadmap

> What we're building and roughly when.

## Now (Q2 2026)

Active work — these are in flight or next up.

- [x] Git version control: commit, branch, merge per document
- [x] Named versions with restore (snapshot any commit as "v1.0", "approved", etc.)
- [x] Fork document (create a branch draft)
- [x] History panel with diff view
- [x] AI chat (thinking partner, not ghostwriter)
- [x] Inline comments anchored to selected text
- [x] Sharing via Cloudflare Tunnel (token-secured links)
- [x] Demo mode with mock peer data
- [ ] Show uncommitted changes indicator in editor
- [ ] Collapsible sidebar

## Next (Q3 2026)

Committed, not yet started. Building toward team collaboration.

- [ ] Peer document sync — view a teammate's workspace read-only, synced via git fetch
- [ ] Agent web search — AI can pull in external research on demand
- [ ] Agent inline suggestions — ghost diff lines the user can accept or reject
- [ ] Terminal pane — run CLI commands in workspace context
- [ ] Claude Code integration — "update the app to reflect this PRD" launches a Claude Code session

## Later

Directional, subject to change.

- Hosted relay (paid) — team sync without self-hosting
- Team access management — share workspaces with ACLs
- Mobile read-only client
- Git hooks for document quality (e.g., require filled sections before commit)

## Deprioritized

- Real-time collaborative editing: async review is the right model for pre-build docs; Google Docs already does real-time better than we could
- Web app: local-first is the differentiator; a web app would require us to store data, which breaks the trust model
- Integrations (Jira, Linear, Notion export): distraction until core loop is loved

Product managers struggle to create a shared, authoritative version of a document that the team trusts enough to build from, because the tools they use treat documents as living notes rather than versioned artifacts — which means engineering teams often start building before the PM is done thinking, and alignment is achieved through Slack threads instead of reviewed documents.

## Evidence

- "Final_v3_APPROVED.docx" is a real naming convention used at companies with $1B+ ARR
- Notion's version history records every keystroke, making it useless for "what did we decide"
- Engineers regularly describe getting requirements mid-sprint via Slack DM
- In interviews: "I can tell you what the doc says today but I can't tell you what changed last week or why"

## Current Workarounds

- Manual version naming in the filename (v1, v2, FINAL, FINAL_APPROVED)
- Google Docs "version history" — exists but not actionable (no branches, no named snapshots)
- Printing to PDF at key moments and attaching to Jira tickets
- Duplicate documents ("Strategy_old.md") kept as informal archives

## Success Criteria

A PM opens Canonic, writes a requirements doc, commits it at two different stages of review, and can show an engineer the exact diff between "first draft" and "approved" — without any of those words being in the filename.

## Research Questions

1. How do PMs currently manage document versions and track decisions over time?
2. What does "this document is ready to build from" mean to them — and how do they signal it?

## Methods Used

Founder interviews (10 PMs at B2B SaaS companies, 20–400 employees), alongside survey of 40 PMs in a product community Slack.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Version history is the #1 unmet need

Every PM interviewed had a story about a decision they couldn't reconstruct. "I know we changed this requirement but I can't find where we landed or why." None of them trusted their current tool's version history. Google Docs' history was described as "too noisy to be useful."

### Finding 2: The "draft → review → approved" ritual is informal and fragile

Most teams have an implicit flow but no tooling that enforces it. Approval happens via a Slack message or a "LGTM" comment. There's no authoritative moment of "this is the committed version."

### Finding 3: PMs are open to Git concepts if explained in their language

"Branch" and "commit" land if you call them "draft" and "checkpoint." Three of ten PMs in initial interviews said they'd wanted something like this for years but assumed it didn't exist.

### Finding 4: AI skepticism is high, but the framing matters

Most PMs have tried AI writing tools and found them underwhelming — they produce generic output that still needs heavy editing. When we described AI that asks questions instead of writes answers, the reaction was universally positive. "That's actually what I need."

## What This Means for the Product

The core loop is: write → commit → review → approve. Everything we build should make that loop faster and more trustworthy. The AI should be inserted at the review step, not the writing step.
